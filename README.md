### Getting-and-Cleaning_Data_Week_4_Course-Project
This is my week 4 assignment 
In this repo you will find the four asked for elements:
  * Code Book 
  * ReadMe (which is this one)
  * Scrip for the analysis 
  * Tidy Data set, the out put of the analysis

## Data
The data that it is going to be analyzed in this project was collected by a smartphone, 
from 30 volunteer subjects, the smartphone measured acceleration while they performed
6 different activities:
  * Walking 
  * Walking up stairs 
  * Walking down stairs 
  * Sitting
  * Standing 
  * Laying 

# Analysis 
Since the output of the data recolected by the smartphone ahs a lot of mesurements and 
data we do not need for the next steps, we need to tidy up the data set. This was 
achived by the programming of an R scrip that cleaned up the data. 
The output of the R scrip was a final tidy data set that can be used down the line.
